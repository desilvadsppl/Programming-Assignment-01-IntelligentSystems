# Image Classification using ResNet

This is a **Streamlit web application** that allows users to upload an image and classify it using a pre-trained **ResNet-50** model. The app predicts the class of the image based on the **ImageNet dataset**. It provides interactive features such as file uploads, progress updates, and visualizations of the model's top predictions.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload an image (JPG format) to be classified by the model.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses **ResNet-50**, a deep convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
- **Top Predictions**: Displays the top 5 predicted classes along with confidence scores.
- **Progress Bar**: Provides real-time progress updates during image processing.
- **Visualization**: A horizontal bar chart of the top 5 predicted classes is displayed.
- **Sidebar Information**: Lists the top 5 predicted classes and their confidence levels.

## Demo

You can try out the app [here](https://blank-app-oklgjmcq36o.streamlit.app/). (Replace this link with your Streamlit Cloud deployment link)

## How It Works

1. **Upload an Image**: Choose a JPG image from your local machine.
2. **Classification**: The app processes the image and classifies it using the ResNet-50 model.
3. **Results**: The predicted class is displayed, along with a bar chart showing the model's confidence for the top 5 predictions.

## How to Run Locally

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
- Pillow
- Matplotlib
- Requests

You can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/desilvadsppl/Programming-Assignment-01-IntelligentSystems.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the app.

## App Overview

- **ResNet-50 Model**: The ResNet-50 model is a 50-layer deep convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. It can classify images into 1,000 categories.
- **ImageNet Labels**: The app uses publicly available ImageNet class labels for displaying predictions.
